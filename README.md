# Diabetes-Readmission-Predictor
This project analyzes a 101,766-record diabetes dataset from 1999-2008 in 130 US hospitals. Focus: HbA1c's role in predicting diabetic patient readmission within 60 days, aiding diagnosis, and treatment decisions for better outcomes. Uses Power BI and Jupyter Notebook.

# Summary
This project aims to analyze a dataset related to diabetes care. The dataset comprises 101,766 records spanning a 10-year period from 1999 to 2008, collected from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes various patient information such as identification, demographics, admission details, lab test results, diagnoses, medication information, and hospital visits. The project's primary objective is to assess the utility of HbA1c test results as an indicator for predicting readmission of diabetic patients to the hospital within 60 days. HbA1c is a critical metric for diagnosing diabetes and guiding treatment decisions, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.

# Project Scope:
- Data Exploration: The project will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
- Modeling: Two classification models will be developed to predict patient readmission within 60 days based on the provided data. These models will leverage the HbA1c test results as a key feature.
- Tools: The analysis will be conducted using PowerBI and Jupyter Notebook for data visualization and model development.
- Dataset Source: The dataset used for this project can be accessed at the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130- us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

This project aims to contribute to the understanding of diabetes care and the potential role of HbA1c in predicting readmissions, ultimately helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions for diabetic patients.
